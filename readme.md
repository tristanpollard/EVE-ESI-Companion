# EVE ESI Companion

An iOS application for the game EVE Online that integrates via SSO and the ESI API to let users manage and view in game activies.

Due to [EULA changes](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/developer-license-agreement-update-2017-10), there is no practical way to distribute the app while allowing tokens to be confined to the device. As such this project is considered abandoned. 

## Getting Started

You must get a Client ID and secret key from [here](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) for the app to function against any authenticated calls.

### The App
